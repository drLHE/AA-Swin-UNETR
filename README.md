This repository contains the code for AA-Swin UNETR, a segmentation model built upon the Swin-UNETR backbone. An attention-augmented mechanism is incorporated through multi-scale decoder layers, enabling the network to simultaneously capture fine- and coarse-level semantic features across full spatial resolutions.We provide the trained weights of the model based on the Oral Posterior Mucosa (OPM) dataset. You can either train the model from scratch or fine-tune it using the pretrained weights we provide.
